## Abstract

Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an imaging technology that applies time-varying currents to the surface of a body and records the resulting voltages to reconstruct and display the electrical conductivity and permittivity in the interior of the body. This technique exploits the electrical properties of tissues such as resistance and capacitance. It aims at exploiting the differences in the passive electrical properties of tissues to generate a tomographic image.

The goal of Electrical Impedance Tomography is to obtain the electrical properties of different materials by applying electric current and measuring the resulting potential difference at the boundaries of the domain. While the numerical accuracy is technically limited by the size of the elements within the finite-element (FE) mesh, using a fine mesh will result in a computationally demanding reconstruction, especially when the region of interest (ROI) is not known. However, this situation is different when the location is known, when one can easily refine the FE model around the target, aiming for greater accuracy around the ROI. It solves an ill-posed inverse problem using the boundary voltage-current data collected from the surface of the object under test. 

Though the spatial resolution is comparatively low compared to conventional tomographic imaging modalities, due to several advantages EIT has been studied for several applications such as medical imaging, material engineering, civil engineering, biotechnology, chemical engineering, MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems), and other fields of engineering and applied sciences.
